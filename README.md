## Hi, There! My Name is Nicolas and welcome to my repository!</h1>

This repository is a space where I share my journey through Data Science, Machine Learning, and Computational Physics.
You'll find projects, experiments, and studies that explore the intersection between technology, data, and science.

Whether it’s training machine learning models, analyzing complex datasets, or applying computational techniques to physics problems, my goal is to learn, share, and collaborate with others passionate about these fields!
